# Prospective Students

## Application Information
To enroll in the class, students must apply and be matched with a project. 

The application requires a resume or CV, history of related courses, and self-assessment of technical skills. Students are asked to rank their preferences for project placement.

The application process starts a few weeks before the quarter begins and initial placements are completed before each quarter.

If you have any questions about the application process please see the [FAQ page](../faq/) before contacting us.
